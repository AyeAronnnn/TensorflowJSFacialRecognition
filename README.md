# JavascriptFacialRecognition
We created a simple AI to identify facial structures through a facemesh. 
With that, we are able to see how an AI can learn different facial structures and move with that person.

Another reason for making this was our inital attempt in understanding a facial recognition AI but also understanding how we can improve with a new language and machine learning model like the Siamese Network.
